# Base VM Setup

## GERRY GIT NOISE hammered  in GitHub 

## VM Tool: VirtualBox

All VMs are setup on my local laptop using VirtualBox

Network:
* NAT: to provide access to internet for downloading software
* Bridge-Only-Adapter: For the private Network.  Each VM has a Static IP address

## Linux Flavor: Ubuntu

I created one headless Ubuntu install.  All other VMs are clones of that.   The private Bridge network IP is set up static IP Address
